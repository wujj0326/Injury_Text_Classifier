# Injury_Text_Classifier
Applied Natural Language Processing to the injury narratives from the NEISS data and visualized the results to understand the frequently used words for each kind of injury. On top of that, I want to build a machine learning classifier to classify the injury type based on the text data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

```
File Name: Injury_Text_Classifier.ipynb
```
### Data

The data can be accessed and read in using this link https://dgoldberg.sdsu.edu/data/neissdata.csv 

### Prerequisites

```
Python 3
```

### Installing Packages

```
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib.pyplot
Sklearn  
NLTK
wordcloud
Json
request
csv
itertools
os
time
unicodedata
collections
operator
re
```

## Running the codes

```
Run each section in the file named Injury_Text_Classifier. 
Each section in the notebook is labelled, and there are comments explaining the code.
```

### Break down into end to end tests

I used the `Decision Tree Classifier` to classify the multi-class target variables

The scores are\
`accuracy`: 0.94\
`recall`: 0.94\
`precision`: 0.94\
`F1-score`: 0.94
